# PocketGans

Welcome! This is the github page for my project, PocketGans.
This project combines the front-end/back-end power of Flask and React with neural networks like DCGAN and GRU to allow users to collect and share digital monsters.

If you want to contact me about this project, my email is: lukeren314@gmail.com

## Registering

After users register with a username and password for the first time, they will start with 1 monster in their collection.

## Viewing Monsters

Monsters can be viewed using the Monsters button in the top left.

## Submitting Codes

Users can type codes into the Enter Monster Codes field and click submit in order to obtain the monsters associated with those codes.
Codes redeemed to users' accounts will appear in the Code Log under the submission boxes.

## Sharing Codes

You can copy your own codes and share them to friends so that they can collect the monsters you have collected. Do this by clicking the Copy Your Monster Codes to Clipboard button and sending the text to your friends.
